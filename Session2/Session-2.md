## Data Types

What is a Data type ?  

- A data type in general defines the type of data a variable is going to hold. A variable is the one which will be declared and can be used to assign a value.  

There are two types of Data Types in Java.  

- Primitive Data Types
- Non-Primitive Data types.

### Primitive Data Types:

There are eight Primitive Data Types:  

- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- boolean
- char

Lets code them.

Go to the below links if you want to read more about primitive data types.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html

In order to learn more about the memory size of each data type then it is available in the below link.

### Non-Primitive Data Types:  

- Class
- Interface
- Arrays

- The most popular non primitive data type is String.

Lets code and learn.
- We will explore the below topics in code.
  - Different approaches of declaring a string.
  - How to check the size of the string?
  - How to add two Strings?
  - How to compare two strings ?
  - How to replace a character in a string ?
  - How to check whether a string is empty ?

Lets code them and explore some of the methods in String.

### Class:
Java is purely object oriented language.  
- Everything in java is represented as a Object.
- We need a Create a class in order to create a object. Class is a template or blue print for the object.

Lets Code and learn.
- We will explore the below topics in code.
  - How to create a class?
  - How to create an object/instance from a class?
  - Difference between static variable and class variable.
  - How to create a method ?
  - How to call a method?

### How to call a method in a different class ?

- We will create two classes ClassA and ClassB.
  - Call a method in classB from classA.

### Conditional Statements in Java:
- if-else
- Switch

Lets learn these by coding it.

### Loops

- for Loop
- while loop

Lets learn these by coding it.
